<section id="usage">
<h2><span>&raquo;Usage</span></h2>
<p>Using it is pretty straight forward. Create several(as much as you need) divs or &laquo;section&raquo; elements each with it's unique id to hold your content. Make sure to have an error section (id="error") with some information to warn the user when he/she mistypes a command or if there is no section with that name, think of it as a 404 page.</p>
<p>A section with id="help" is also required so you can list all the available sections and let your users know what words to write to access that particular content.</p>
<p>The input field must be a standalone element and must not be placed inside any of the content divs or sections, and make sure you give it a classname "command", if you want to name it anything else you need to edit the app.js and change all instances of .command in the script to match your chosen classname.</p>
<p>In short, just view the source code of this demo, copy/modify it to your liking making sure you include the error and help sections.</p>
